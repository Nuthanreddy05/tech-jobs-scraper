    "description": "<div><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Rigetti Computing is building the world\u2019s most powerful computers to solve humanity\u2019s most pressing problems. We believe this technology will fundamentally change the world for the better and will affect nearly every industry over the coming decades. Rigetti Computing is leading this change by developing and demonstrating quantum computing applications in quantum optimization, quantum machine learning, and quantum simulation.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">About the internship</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">As an intern, you will work alongside quantum researchers to develop and implement a quantum many-body simulation aimed at solving classically intractable problems and answering fundamental questions about quantum system dynamics. In the context of contemporary noisy quantum computers, you will co-design experiments specifically tailored to extract maximum performance from Rigetti's hardware. Using numerical simulation tools, you will define the crossover regime where classical emulation falters as problem size increases, but experimental quantum performance is challenged by noise. You will execute experiments on Rigetti's QPUs and benchmark the results against defined targets to help identify the threshold for quantum advantage. This role offers a unique opportunity to conduct high-impact research in an industrial R&amp;D environment, working on a cross-functional project that involves Applications and Quantum Engineering staff.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The internship should last a minimum of 3 months over the summer of 2026, with flexible start and end dates. Although the mentors will be remote, there is flexibility to work remotely or in Rigetti\u2019s office in Berkeley, CA.</span></div>",
