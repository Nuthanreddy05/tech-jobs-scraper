    "description": "<div><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">Rigetti is seeking a motivated student (Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s, or PhD in CS, SWE, or related field) to develop a production-oriented, on-premise data automation and computer vision solution. This is an applied engineering role focused on building operational systems intended for future production integration rather than academic research.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">The intern will develop a Python backend to process structured inspection data and apply image classification, design a retrainable model workflow, and contribute to a lightweight web UI for reviewing results. The intern will work closely with Defect Metrology and Software Engineering teams to ensure domain accuracy and production-quality implementation. This role is ideal for students pursuing industry careers in software engineering, machine learning engineering, or applied AI.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 18px\">Educational Value</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">Gain hands-on experience building a production-oriented computer vision system in an industrial environment. The internship provides exposure to backend automation, machine learning integration, retraining workflows, and lightweight full-stack development. Skills developed align directly with industry roles in Software Engineering, Machine Learning Engineering, and Applied AI.</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 24px\">Key Responsibilities</span></div>",
