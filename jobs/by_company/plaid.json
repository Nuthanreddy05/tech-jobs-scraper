To support that, we need to scale our data systems while maintaining correct and complete data. We provide tooling and guidance to teams across engineering, product, and business and help them explore our data quickly and safely to get the data insights they need, which ultimately helps Plaid serve our customers more effectively.&nbsp;Data Engineers heavily leverage SQL and Python to build data workflows. We use tools like DBT, Airflow, Redshift, ElasticSearch, Atlanta, and Retool to orchestrate data pipelines and define workflows. We work with engineers, product managers, business intelligence, data analysts, and many other teams to build Plaid's data strategy and a data-first mindset. Our engineering culture is IC-driven -- we favor bottom-up ideation and empowerment of our incredibly talented team. We are looking for engineers who are motivated by creating impact for our consumers and customers, growing together as a team, shipping the MVP, and leaving things better than we found them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">You will be in a high impact role that will directly enable business leaders to make faster and more informed business judgements based on the datasets you build.

You will have the opportunity to learn best practices and up-level your technical skills from our strong DE team and from the broader Data Platform team. You will collaborate with and have strong and cross functional partnerships with literally all teams at Plaid from Engineering to Product to Marketing/Finance etc.</span></div>",
